# sourcesage-dev-test

Create a Q & A application that has the following functionality.
1. a user can ask a question
2. a user can answer a question

Don't worry about having actual users, when you ask/answer a quesiton,
just have an extra field where you can type whatever name you want.

You can write this application in whatever languages you prefer.
For backend developers: We like Python and PHP (but we really don't mind if you write it in other languages)
For iOS and Android developers: Do you even have another choice?

You should fork this repository and put your work there. 
This exercise should take no longer than 4 hours. However, you are not timed
and you can send us a pull request whenever you finish. (If you have something 
live going on, even better!)
